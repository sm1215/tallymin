A simple utility to help keep track of scores for trivia games.

Add rows and team names.
Lock the names to avoid accidental changes.
Modify the score column directly for quick direct changes.
Use the 'Modify Amount' column to increment or decrement a score. It accepts positive and negative numbers. Press the Apply button to alter the current score by the Modify Amount.

The same concept can be applied to multiple rows by just selecting them and using the Multi-row Modification controls.
