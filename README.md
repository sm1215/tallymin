A simple utility to help keep track of scores for trivia games. First version with functionality first, styles to come later.

![Preview](images/preview.png)

Add rows and team names.

Lock the names to avoid accidental changes.

Click into the Score column directly for quick modification changes.

Click into the 'Modify Amount' column to increment or decrement a score. It accepts positive and negative numbers. 

Press the Apply button to alter the current score by the Modify Amount.

The same concept can be applied to multiple rows by just selecting them and using the Multi-row Modification controls.

Use the sortable controls at the top of the Name or Score columns to sort alphabetically or by highscore.
